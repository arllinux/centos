RAID hardware failed and both SATA x 2 TB stops working, tried enable/disable
RAID controller without luck, Add/Remove drives but no boot, kernel panic and
stuck.

Now what I want is to boot one hard disk to restore services so I tried:
# fsck /dec/sda

but it gives error
# unknown filesystem type 'isw_raid_member'

So the solution is , remove RAID metadata from the drives and boot normally.
# dmraid -rE /dev/sda
# reboot

And Hard disk start workingâ€¦..
